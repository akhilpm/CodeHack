# Decorator
This code contains decorator demo in python
==============================================
1. The decorator is used to store the results of subprograms in a dictionary data structure. This can save the time for solving the same subproblems again and again, since the solution can be directly fetch from the dictionary.
2. Demo is given on fibonacci series. Check the difference in running time with and without caching.
3. This decorator can be used in any dynamic programming formulation to avoid repeated solving of same subproblems. The template is fixed.
